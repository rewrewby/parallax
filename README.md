# Parallax

Official Golang implementation of the **Parallax protocol**.

> **Parallax** is a Proof-of-Work timechain protocol designed to merge the security model of Bitcoin with the programmability of the EVM. It combines Bitcoin’s fixed monetary rules with Ethereum’s virtual machine to deliver a scarce, decentralized, and programmable timechain.

## Building from Source

Parallax requires **Go 1.25+** and a C compiler.

```bash
make prlx
```

Build the full suite:

```bash
make all
```

---

## Executables

Binaries are located under `build/bin`:

| Command        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **`prlx`** | Main CLI client. Runs full, archive, or light nodes; exposes JSON-RPC over HTTP, WS, and IPC. |
| `clef`         | Stand-alone signer for secure account operations. |
| `devp2p`       | Networking utilities to inspect and interact at the P2P layer. |
| `abigen`       | Generates type-safe Go bindings from contract ABIs. |
| `bootnode`     | Lightweight discovery node to bootstrap networks. |
| `evm`          | Execute and debug EVM bytecode snippets in isolation. |
| `rlpdump`      | Decode RLP structures into a human-readable form. |
| `puppeth`      | Wizard to create and manage custom Parallax networks. |

## Running a Node

Mainnet (interactive console):

```bash
prlx console
```

Testnet:

```bash
prlx --testnet console
```

### Hardware Recommendations

- **Minimum**: 2 cores, 4 GB RAM, 250 GB SSD, 8 Mbps  
- **Recommended**: 4+ cores, 8 GB RAM, 500 TB SSD, 25+ Mbps

## Mining Parallax coins

Parallax miner can be started with:

```
prlx --miner.coinbase <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS> --miner.threads 1 --mine
```

You can use your existing web3 wallet address from MetaMask or any other Ethereum based wallet. Or create a new wallet address using either `clef` or `parallaxkey`:

```
parallaxkey generate
```

```
clef newaccount
```

## JSON-RPC (Developers)

IPC is enabled by default. Enable HTTP/WS explicitly:

```
--http --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.port 8545 --http.api eth,net,web3
--ws   --ws.addr   0.0.0.0 --ws.port   8546 --ws.api   eth,net,web3
```

> ⚠️ **Security**: Do **not** expose RPC to the public Internet. Use firewalls, auth proxies, and restricted origins.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions aligned with **neutrality, openness, and decentralization**.

1. Fork the repo
2. Implement your changes
3. Open a PR against `main`

**Guidelines**

- Format with `gofmt`; document public symbols following Go conventions.  
- Keep commits focused; prefix messages with affected packages (e.g., `prlx, rpc:`).
